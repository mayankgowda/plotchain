# Editorial Checklist

## MLLM Capitalization

**Standard**: Use "MLLM" (all caps) throughout the paper.

**Variations to Check**:
- "Mllm" → "MLLM"
- "mllm" → "MLLM"
- "multimodal LLM" → "MLLM" (or "multimodal LLM (MLLM)" on first use)
- "multimodal large language model" → "multimodal large language model (MLLM)" on first use, then "MLLM"

**First Use Pattern**:
- "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)" or "multimodal large language models (MLLMs)"
- Then use "MLLM" or "MLLMs" consistently thereafter

## Other Editorial Items

- Consistent use of "PlotChain" (capitalized, no space)
- Consistent use of "plotread" (lowercase, one word) for tolerance policy
- Consistent use of "checkpoint" vs "checkpoint field" (be consistent)
- Consistent use of "final field" vs "final answer field"
- Numbers: Use numerals for percentages (e.g., "72.3%") and measurements, spell out small numbers at start of sentences
- Figure/Table references: "Figure X" or "Fig. X" (be consistent)
- Section references: "Section X" or "Sec. X" (be consistent)
